## Brandon

I grew up in Northville, Michigan and have spent most of my life there. However, I spent two years of high school in Dallas, Texas. Growing up, I played several sports and in high school I played golf and hockey.
Currently, I am a graduate student at The University of Michigan - Ross School of Business studying Business Analytics. I chose to pursue this degree in hopes of landing a job in the field of sports analytics. I love watching the NBA and the NFL (as well as college basketball and football) and I took a few analytics and ML classes in my undergrad that opened my eyes to the power and promise of AI.

Even though it is early in the program, I can already say that I have genuinely enjoyed everyone I have met so far. This is a talented group that I believe will do wonderful things.

Previous Education
I graduated from my BBA program this spring, also at The Ross School of Business. I loved my undergraduate education and the experience that came with it. I find that the professors at The Ross School of Business are of the highest quality.

I am currently studying Business Analytics as graduate student at The University of Michigan - Ross School of Business.
I have graduated from University of Hong Kong with a bachelorâ€™s degree of Economics and Finance in 2020. Then, I spent 2 years in the Lenovo's global future leader program as a corporate branding specialist, responsible for branding campaigns mainly targeting the gen z market.
I love cats, taking photos, and skiing. I have a 2 months old kitten in Ann Arbor whose name is BoBo. Nice to meet everyone in MBAN 501! Hope what we are doing could be helpful for every reader.
