Since many questions of this type start off with “Tell me about a time when…” it is crucial that you are locked and loaded with a handful of stories that you are very familiar with and know all the details of. Remember to choose stories from your life that are flexible and multifaceted enough to be used for a variety of different question types. Take your time Do not get flustered if nothing comes to mind right away, instead, keep your composure and keep thinking. If you just start rambling right away and don’t have a moral to the story, the interviewer will not be impressed. It is better to say, “that’s a very good question” and then ask for a little bit of time to think. Research the job position for desired skills This will come into play when building your story bank since you can choose stories that highlight your fit for the job. Also, it will help you choose how to answer the questions once you get into the room with your interviewer. Do not pretend that you have never failed When an interviewer asks you about your greatest weakness, don’t say something like, “I just work too hard.” Instead, give them an honest and authentic answer and then tell them how you are working on yourself to improve in the area of weakness. In truth, this particular question is so common that you should have a prepared answer for it, but that is not true of every possible question. Be polite and display positive mannerisms Remember to smile, shake hands, don’t sit until invited to do so, make eye contact, and bring a positive attitude. Dress appropriately to show the interviewer that you care about the job and value their time. Do not be late. If they show up in a bad mood, or they show up late, that is not your fault. Do your best not to get rattled and try to bring a positive attitude to the room.
