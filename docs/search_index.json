It is more important in the project management environment. For example, it helps to improve either the individual performance or the performance of the entire project. Difficulties in receiving feedback Brain system: our brain is biologically hard-wired to run away from negative feedback. People always subconsciously protect themselves when something is threatening. Overconfidence bias: Peoples subjective confidence in own abilities is far greater than actual objective abilities which leads to experience dissonance. The 3R Model Receive: Receive is at the first stage in this receiving feedback model. At first, recipients should notice others names and objectives with managed emotions. During the conversation, it is better to be engaged for better understanding. For example, asking questions to seek out more information or examples is a good strategy to show your curiousness. At the end of conversation, please remember to say thanks. Reflect: After conversations, it is important to have the thoughts ready to share. During the thinking process, the first step is to evaluate the talking points and looking for what might be right. Then, it is good to check in with others and share opinions to validate. One important reminder is that please dont let yourself formulate the responses while the others are talking. Respond: After receiving ideas, it is beneficial to develop and execute a self-change plan which may includes the specific steps to improve current situations. Lastly, please remember to check back with the feedback giver to evaluate are there any missing points or any potential improvements. 3.4 Cultural Differences 3.4.1 Chronemics The study of how time affects communication. It is used to understand the use of time in differing cultures. Some cultures see time as something concrete and linear, while other cultures see time as something rather relative and cyclic. The former perspective on time was termed by Edward T. Hall as monochronic and the latter as polychronic. 3.4.2 Proxemics Proxemics is the interpretation of spatial relationships within the context of cultural normalities and psychosocial factors. The interpretation of these relationships determines the dynamics of human interaction and reaction to their surroundings. Proxemics is the act of betraying affiliations through the dynamics of proximity. This occurs at the unconscious, subconscious, and conscious levels. Additionally, proxemics is the proximity or distance to and from other people and is based upon physiological, sociological, and physical principles. Proxemics may be categorized as relative distance, proxemics push or pull distance. 3.4.3 Direct vs.Â Indirect There is a spectrum of formality throughout the cultures of the world, with some cultures being direct and explicit. Others cultures are less direct and more ambiguous. The theory of cross-cultural communication styles is extensive, but for our purpose we will focus on the distinction between direct and indirect communication styles.
