However, during my undergraduate study, my related experience really helped me to clarify my ultimate passion: analytics, especially in business analytics field, which combines my professional knowledge in the business field and more practical knowledge in the data field. To enrich my understanding, I have taken several analytical courses, interned in Amazon and completed a data certificate in UCLA. Finally, I was successfully admitted by Ross, which is the most valuable experience in my life I believe. After classes, I have joined several student organizations, including the International Consulting Network, Accounting Club of UIUC and Overseas China Educational Foundation. I really enjoyed those activities such as doing real-world consulting projects, fundraising events and so on. In my spare time, I love watching movies, listening to music, traveling and shopping. Oh! One interesting fun fact about me is that I have a super cute cat. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
