Overall, we believe that all stages in our group project work smoothly with the help of class materials. At first, in the beginning stage, we established team charter to guide future works based on the course readings, such as the discipline of teams, building company’s vision and mission, and the effect of a team charter. Additionally, we apply the related concepts for group decision making and receiving &amp; seeking feedbacks to topic and content selections. For instance, since we meet all the requirements for making group decision, we set up several meetings aimed to formulate the structure for our project’s content. Then, during each meeting, the guidelines for making and receiving feedbacks really helps us to improve the efficiency of communications.
