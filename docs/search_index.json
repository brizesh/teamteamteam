In general, we chose to make our project about approaching teamwork and collaboration questions in the behavioral interview process. The primary reason is that it will be useful for future MBAn students as well as ourselves. This research we will conduct for this project will benefit us later this year during our job searches. Hopefully, it will also benefit future students as well. We also want to improve our teamwork, collaborative skills, and process-building capabilities. Becoming more comfortable with GitHub while we complete this project together is another advantage. This will also help us land a good job and start our careers in the best place possible. Behavioral questions that involve teamwork and collaboration are crucial since most companies are highly concerned with our teamwork capabilities. The world is becoming increasingly complex which will make teamwork and collaborative skills more and more valuable.

However, I spent two years of high school in Dallas, Texas. Growing up, I played several sports and in high school I played golf and hockey. Currently, I am a graduate student at The University of Michigan - Ross School of Business studying Business Analytics. I chose to pursue this degree in hopes of landing a job in the field of sports analytics. I love watching the NBA and the NFL (as well as college basketball and football) and I took a few analytics and ML classes in my undergrad that opened my eyes to the power and promise of AI. Even though it is early in the program, I can already say that I have genuinely enjoyed everyone I have met so far. This is a talented group that I believe will do wonderful things. Previous Education I graduated from my BBA program this spring, also at The Ross School of Business. I loved my undergraduate education and the experience that came with it. I find that the professors at The Ross School of Business are of the highest quality. 2.3 Yulin 2.4 Andrew Born: Columbus, Ohio Education: University of Michigan Master of Business Analytics, April 2023 University of Cincinnati Bachelor of Science, Civil Engineering, April 2014 Activities: Delta Tau Delta Fraternity, University of Cincinnati Mens Ice Hockey Club Professional Work Experience: 2015-2016 Lead Engineer, KBKG -Completed 28 cost segregation studies, 45 IRS Form 3115 projects, and four comprehensive fixed asset reviews 2018-2021 Senior Engineer, ICS Tax, LLC -Completed 118 cost segregation studies and two comprehensive fixed asset reviews for Fortune 500 companies Military Experience 2019-2020 Supply Officer, Georgian Liaison Team Operation Freedoms Sentinel 2021-2022 Operations Officer, Combat Logistics Battalion 451 Operation Allies Welcome Military Education Officer Candidates School Basic Officers Course Ground Supply Officers Course Marine Advisor Course Regional and Culture Studies Program Expeditionary Warfare School Hobbies and Interests: Columbus Blue Jackets Hockey Michigan Wolverines Football 2.5 Yidan Hello, my name is Yidan Gu, a current MBAn student from Ross School of Business.I love dealing with numbers such as different kinds of math problems so I chose accounting as my undergraduate major in the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. However, during my undergraduate study, my related experience really helped me to clarify my ultimate passion: analytics, especially business analytics, which combines my professional knowledge in the business field and more practical knowledge in the data field. To enrich my understanding, I have taken several analytical courses, interned in Amazon and completed a data certificate in UCLA. Finally, I was successfully admitted by Ross, which is the most valuable experience in my life I believe. After classes, I have joined several student organizations, including the International Consulting Network, Accounting Club of UIUC and Overseas China Educational Foundation. I really enjoyed those activities such as doing real-world consulting projects, fundraising events and so on. In my spare time, I love watching movies, listening to music, traveling and shopping. Oh! One interesting fun fact about me is that I have a super cute cat.
