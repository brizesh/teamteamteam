In general, we chose to make our project about approaching teamwork and collaboration questions in the behavioral interview process. The primary reason is that it will be useful for future MBAn students as well as ourselves. This research we will conduct for this project will benefit us later this year during our job searches. Hopefully, it will also benefit future students as well. We also want to improve our teamwork, collaborative skills, and process-building capabilities. Becoming more comfortable with GitHub while we complete this project together is another advantage. This will also help us land a good job and start our careers in the best place possible. Behavioral questions that involve teamwork and collaboration are crucial since most companies are highly concerned with our teamwork capabilities. The world is becoming increasingly complex which will make teamwork and collaborative skills more and more valuable.

However, I spent two years of high school in Dallas, Texas. Growing up, I played several sports and in high school I played golf and hockey. Currently, I am a graduate student at The University of Michigan - Ross School of Business studying Business Analytics. I chose to pursue this degree in hopes of landing a job in the field of sports analytics. I love watching the NBA and the NFL (as well as college basketball and football) and I took a few analytics and ML classes in my undergrad that opened my eyes to the power and promise of AI. Even though it is early in the program, I can already say that I have genuinely enjoyed everyone I have met so far. This is a talented group that I believe will do wonderful things. Previous Education I graduated from my BBA program this spring, also at The Ross School of Business. I loved my undergraduate education and the experience that came with it. I find that the professors at The Ross School of Business are of the highest quality. 2.3 Yulin 2.4 Andrew 2.5 Yidan Hello, my name is Yidan Gu, a current MBAn student from Ross School of Business.I love dealing with numbers such as different kinds of math problems so I chose accounting as my undergraduate major in the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. However, during my undergraduate study, my related experience really helped me to clarify my ultimate passion: analytics, especially business analytics, which combines my professional knowledge in the business field and more practical knowledge in the data field. To enrich my understanding, I have taken several analytical courses, interned in Amazon and completed a data certificate in UCLA. Finally, I was successfully admitted by Ross, which is the most valuable experience in my life I believe. After classes, I have joined several student organizations, including the International Consulting Network, Accounting Club of UIUC and Overseas China Educational Foundation. I really enjoyed those activities such as doing real-world consulting projects, fundraising events and so on. In my spare time, I love watching movies, listening to music, traveling and shopping. Oh! One interesting fun fact about me is that I have a super cute cat.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
