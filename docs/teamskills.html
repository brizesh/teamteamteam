<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Group Decision Making<a href="teamskills.html#group-decision-making" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Group decision making is a strategy that is used when working in a team setting. In particular, teams collectively making a decision among the proposed solutions is the idea of group decision making. This way when the team makes a decision, it is not made by one person, but rather the whole group. Group Decision making is much different than individual decision making and usually more effective, since you can get multiple people’s opinions before making an informed decision.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> What are Group Decision Making Strategies?<a href="teamskills.html#what-are-group-decision-making-strategies" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Group Decision Making strategies are manners and techniques that groups can use when they need to come to a consensus about an issue or problem.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> When And When not to Use Decision Making?<a href="teamskills.html#when-and-when-not-to-use-decision-making" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Though we may think that group decision strategies should always be used, there are some cases where we may not use them. Most of the times in school and work environments, group group decision making is the best course of action; however, there are certain cases where it should not be used.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use</strong></p>
<p>Whenever working in a team, the first thing to think of should be whether the team needs to use group decision making. One instance you should use group decision making is when the team is diverse. This way when making a decision, you can include all members of the team. When a team is diverse in background, each member could provide an interesting perspective that someone from a different culture might not have though of.</p>
<p>Another situation you should use group decision making is when the group as a whole is poorly informed of the situation or problem. Mindlessly making a decision when you don’t know enough about the problem or issue can lead to very bad decisions which could have major consequences. However, if all members of team work together in coming to a decion, they can all help each other understand the situation and therefore, the group can make a more informed decision.</p>
<p>You should also use group decision making when you have a big decision to make. The larger the decision, the more input you should have. This way, you can be as informed as possible before making such a monumental decision. The bigger the decision, the larger the consequences will be (good or bad), so if you get as many people’s feedback and input, the better the decision is likely to be.</p>
<p>Finally, you should be using group decision making when a group has just been formed. A newly formed group is probably still getting used to each other, so it is best to make any decision collectively, especially if it affects the group in a substantial way. This is also a great way of getting to know your team better. You can explore each others background and individual decision making progress and then come together to make a good decision.</p>
<p><strong>When Not to Use</strong></p>
<p>Though group decision making seems like a great option, there are situations when you might want to rely on another method or just one individual to make the decision. One of these situations is when time is limited. If time is limited, then you want to make a decision quickly, and group decision making is probably not the best way to do that. Instead, you may want to select a leader who knows a lot more about the problem/issue and have them make the decision because it will be much faster.</p>
<p>Another case group decision making might not be the best strategy is when you have an experienced person or professional in you group. For instance, if the group is making a decision on where to hold a business meeting, then this decision should probably be made by someone who is well informed about social-business meetings. If this person has been to a lot of these outings, they probably know more than other people in the group, so a decision coming primarily from that person might be more helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>A difficult conversation refers to the conversations that are planned discussion about any uncomfortable topics or negative experience, where the goal is still to share different perspectives, to build mutual understanding, and to develop respect instead of persuading among members. In this section, we will at first discuss some concepts related to the difficult conversations and then visit the most important model to solve this issue.</p>
<p><strong>4 D’s in difficult conversations:</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Denial: other people reject the information that you provided</li>
<li>Deflection: other people change the subject</li>
<li>Disruption: other people shout, swear, sob, and storm out</li>
<li>Dumping on the boss: other people try to steer the conversation into criticism of you</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Types of difficult conversations</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The “what happened” conversation
This kind of conversation usually is about disagreements in what happened or what should happen.</li>
<li>The “feelings” conversation
Almost every difficult conversation content the topic of feeling. This kind of conversation relates to any invalid thoughts and unnegotiable perceptions.</li>
<li>The “identity” conversation
This kind of conversation usually relates to the impact and key objective of each talk.</li>
<li>Examples in real-world:
Dealing with poor performance/unpowerful decisions (power imbalance)/problems with peer coworkers such as relationship difficulties</li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Identify the problem and acknowledge different points of view</li>
<li>Be certain this is a problem that is worth addressing</li>
<li>Invite the other person to talk with you</li>
<li>Start the conversation by “seeking first to understand”</li>
<li>Share your own point of view, your intentions and your feelings. Use “I” statements. Take responsibility for your part.</li>
<li>Talk about the future and what can happen differently, so you don’t end up in the same place</li>
<li>Thank the other person for talking with you</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> 3 R’s Model for Receiving Feedback<a href="teamskills.html#rs-model-for-receiving-feedback" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>According to the definition, receiving feedback refers to hearing and accepting that the other person has a particular opinion, which gives the recipient the opportunity to listen, absorb, and act on important messages. It is more important in the project management environment. For example, it helps to improve either the individual performance or the performance of the entire project.</p>
<p><strong>Difficulties in receiving feedback</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Brain system: our brain is biologically hard-wired to run away from negative feedback. People always subconsciously protect themselves when something is threatening.</li>
<li>Overconfidence bias: People’s subjective confidence in own abilities is far greater than actual objective abilities which leads to experience dissonance.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The 3R Model</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Receive:
Receive is at the first stage in this receiving feedback model. At first, recipients should notice others’ names and objectives with managed emotions. During the conversation, it is better to be engaged for better understanding. For example, asking questions to seek out more information or examples is a good strategy to show your curiousness. At the end of conversation, please remember to say thanks.</p></li>
<li><p>Reflect:
After conversations, it is important to have the thoughts ready to share. During the thinking process, the first step is to evaluate the talking points and looking for what might be right. Then, it is good to check in with others and share opinions to validate. One important reminder is that please don’t let yourself formulate the responses while the others are talking.</p></li>
<li><p>Respond:
After receiving ideas, it is beneficial to develop and execute a self-change plan which may includes the specific steps to improve current situations. Lastly, please remember to check back with the feedback giver to evaluate are there any missing points or any potential improvements.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Chronemics<a href="teamskills.html#chronemics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>The study of how time affects communication. It is used to understand the use of time in differing cultures. Some cultures see time as something concrete and linear, while other cultures see time as something rather relative and cyclic. The former perspective on time was termed by Edward T. Hall as monochronic and the latter as polychronic.</p>

<div id="proxemics" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="3.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Proxemics<a href="teamskills.html#proxemics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Proxemics is the interpretation of spatial relationships within the context of cultural normalities and psychosocial factors. The interpretation of these relationships determines the dynamics of human interaction and reaction to their surroundings. Proxemics is the act of betraying affiliations through the dynamics of proximity. This occurs at the unconscious, subconscious, and conscious levels. Additionally, proxemics is the proximity or distance to and from other people and is based upon physiological, sociological, and physical principles. Proxemics may be categorized as relative distance, proxemics push or pull distance.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Direct vs. Indirect<a href="teamskills.html#direct-vs.-indirect" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>There is a spectrum of formality throughout the cultures of the world, with some cultures being direct and explicit. Others cultures are less direct and more ambiguous. The theory of cross-cultural communication styles is extensive, but for our purpose we will focus on the distinction between direct and indirect communication styles.</p>
