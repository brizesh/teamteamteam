# Introduction

Hi, we are The Team the Team the Team from MABn 501. During the enriched two months, we learned about many concepts of teamwork and how to adapt ourselves in a Agile working style. We chose to integrate our learning and the application of these concepts in reality, and make our project focusing on approaching behavioral questions in interview process. This research we will conduct for this project will benefit us later this year during our job searches. Hopefully, the output will also benefit future students as well. Through the project, we also want to improve our teamwork, collaborative skills, and
process-building capabilities. Behavioral questions that involve teamwork and collaboration are crucial since most companies are highly concerned with our teamwork capabilities. The world is becoming increasingly complex which will make teamwork and collaborative skills more and more valuable.
